Basic steps to take to perform a buffer overflow test:

1. Find out how large the buffer is, for example using a fuzzer such as fuzz.py

2. When the length is reached, generate a uniq string of that length to find exact
   length where $esp is overwritten

   For example the tool:
	pattern_create.rb
   The complement to that tool is
	pattern_offset.rb
   
   That will take your hex values and give back the exact offset.

3. Generate some shellcode,
	msfvenom 

4. Find out which hex chars are not valid, commonly 
	Hex  regex name	
	\x00 \0    Null
	\x0A \n    Line feed 
	\x0D \r    Carriage return
